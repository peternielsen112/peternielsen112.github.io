    <article class='mainc'>Cash Culasso has made a grave mistake. The Client has possession of all 21 Prisms and is making his way for the Cores - but all current technology fails to travel through the Cores' barrier fields. Now, rumors are circulating of a phantom ship - made of some material that resists all forces and is invisible to scanners. Cash and the Guardians must destroy the ship before The Client obtains it and everything is lost.</article>
