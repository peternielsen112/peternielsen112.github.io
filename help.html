    <article class='mainc'>Dave Johnson is relatively normal. He lives in a relatively normal apartment (just be careful with the windows) with his relatively normal best friends: Dan, who has a strange obsession with Star Wars and chicken nuggets, and Christi, who's sort of rebellious and works in IT. He works for a relatively normal company with his relatively normal development team (their names are not important, just know that they are relatively normal). He even drives a relatively normal car - an old pickup that can barely fit him and his relatively normal best friends. But one day, Dave steps into a shady alley and meets Crisper and That Guy, two dealers who are selling something quite unusual - the internet.</article>
