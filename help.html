      <h4><a class="chapter" href="tsof.html"><em>The Swords of Fate</em></a></h4>
      <p>The evil sorcerer Quatremaine is arising in the West after a defeat many years ago - and the Overking will do nothing to stop him. Kallwyn Jameson, a blacksmith from the Western Dunes, must band together with a motley crew of vagabonds and soldiers to stop Quatremaine - and his loyal, unthinking army of Fire-Kin - from taking over the world.</p>
      <h4><a class="chapter" href="wyuuprebellion.html"><em>Chronicles of Wyuup: Rebellion</em></a></h4>
      <p>The land of Wyuup is engaged in a civil war. Two factions - the Revolution and the Resistance - fight for control of the government and the people. And Ren is stuck in the middle of it. Upon finding a mysterious tavern in the woods, he discovers a sort of neutral zone between the two factions. But the neutral zone has more to it than meets the eye - and Ren needs to figure out what its true motives are.</p>
      <h4><a class="chapter" href="cash21.html"><em>Cash Culasso and the 21 Prisms</em></a></h4>
      <p>Cash Culasso, interstellar treasure hunter and daredevil, finds himself in deeper than he'd expected when a mysterious client hires him to steal twenty-one mystical objects called Prisms.</p>

    <article class='mainc'>Dave Johnson is relatively normal. He lives in a relatively normal apartment (just be careful with the windows) with his relatively normal best friends: Dan, who has a strange obsession with Star Wars and chicken nuggets, and Christi, who's sort of rebellious and works in IT. He works for a relatively normal company with his relatively normal development team (their names are not important, just know that they are relatively normal). He even drives a relatively normal car - an old pickup that can barely fit him and his relatively normal best friends. But one day, Dave steps into a shady alley and meets Crisper and That Guy, two dealers who are selling something quite unusual - the internet.</article>
