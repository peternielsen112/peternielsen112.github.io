      <h3>Get Started on a Series</h3>
      <h4><a class="chapter" href="tsof.html"><em>The Swords of Fate</em></a></h4>
      <p>The evil sorcerer Quatremaine is arising in the West after a defeat many years ago - and the Overking will do nothing to stop him. Kallwyn Jameson, a blacksmith from the Western Dunes, must band together with a motley crew of vagabonds and soldiers to stop Quatremaine - and his loyal, unthinking army of Fire-Kin - from taking over the world.</p>
      <h4><a class="chapter" href="wyuuprebellion.html"><em>Chronicles of Wyuup: Rebellion</em></a></h4>
      <p>The land of Wyuup is engaged in a civil war. Two factions - the Revolution and the Resistance - fight for control of the government and the people. And Ren is stuck in the middle of it. Upon finding a mysterious tavern in the woods, he discovers a sort of neutral zone between the two factions. But the neutral zone has more to it than meets the eye - and Ren needs to figure out what its true motives are.</p>
      <h4><a class="chapter" href="cash21.html"><em>Cash Culasso and the 21 Prisms</em></a></h4>
      <p>Cash Culasso, interstellar treasure hunter and daredevil, finds himself in deeper than he'd expected when a mysterious client hires him to steal twenty-one mystical objects called Prisms.</p>

      <h3 class="right">About Me</h3>
      <p>I am a person of many talents, based somewhere on Earth. I write, program, collect coins, jam to the DOOM soundtrack, and do math in my free time. Currently I'm working on several projects related to command line tools based on Python and shell scripts while simultaneously writing several novels on different subjects. Some projects I've released are <a href="https://github.com/peternielsen112/periodictableindex">the Periodic Table Index</a> and <a href="https://github.com/peternielsen112/hopeforthegalaxy">a game called Hope for the Galaxy</a>.</p>
