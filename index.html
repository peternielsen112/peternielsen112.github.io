      <p>I am a person of many talents, based somewhere on Earth. I write, program, collect coins, jam to the DOOM soundtrack, and do math in my free time. Currently I'm working on several projects related to command line tools based on Python and shell scripts while simultaneously writing several novels on different subjects. Some projects I've released are <a href="https://github.com/peternielsen112/periodictableindex">the Periodic Table Index</a> and <a href="https://github.com/peternielsen112/hopeforthegalaxy">a game called Hope for the Galaxy</a>.</p>
